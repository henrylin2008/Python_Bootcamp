Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are text matching patterns described with a formal syntax. You'll often hear regular expressions referred to as 'regex' or 'regexp' in conversation. Regular expressions can include a variety of rules, fro finding repetition, to text-matching, and much more. As you advance in Python you'll see that a lot of your parsing problems can be solved with regular expressions (they're also a common interview question!).

If you're familiar with Perl, you'll notice that the syntax for regular expressions are very similar in Python. We will be using the re module with Python for this lecture.
