In this lecture we will be doing a quick overview of Python Statements. This lecture will emphasize differences between Python and other languages such as C++.

There are two reasons we take this approach for learning the context of Python Statements:

1.) If you are coming from a different language this will rapidly accelerate your understanding of Python.
2.) Learning about statements will allow you to be able to read other languages more easily in the future.

Python vs Other Languages
Let's create a simple statement that says: "If a is greater than b, assign 2 to a and 4 to b"

Take a look at these two if statements (we will learn about building out if statements soon).

Version 1 (Other Languages)

if (a>b){
    a = 2;
    b = 4;
}

Version 2 (Python)

if a>b:
    a = 2
    b = 4
