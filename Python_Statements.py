In this lecture we will be doing a quick overview of Python Statements. This lecture will emphasize differences between Python and other languages such as C++.

There are two reasons we take this approach for learning the context of Python Statements:

1.) If you are coming from a different language this will rapidly accelerate your understanding of Python.
2.) Learning about statements will allow you to be able to read other languages more easily in the future.
