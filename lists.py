Lists
Earlier when discussing strings we introduced the concept of a sequence in Python. Lists can be thought of the most general version of a sequence in Python. Unlike strings, they are mutable, meaning the elements inside a list can be changed!

In this section we will learn about:

1.) Creating lists
2.) Indexing and Slicing Lists
3.) Basic List Methods
4.) Nesting Lists
5.) Introduction to List Comprehensions

Lists are constructed with brackets [] and commas separating every element in the list.

Let's go ahead and see how we can construct lists!

In [2]:
# Assign a list to an variable named my_list
my_list = [1,2,3]
We just created a list of integers, but lists can actually hold different object types. For example:

In [4]:
my_list = ['A string',23,100.232,'o']
Just like strings, the len() function will tell you how many items are in the sequence of the list.

In [6]:
len(my_list)
Out[6]:
4
