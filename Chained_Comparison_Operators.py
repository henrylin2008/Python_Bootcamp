An interesting feature of Python is the ability to chain multiple comparisons to perform a more complex test. You can use these chained comparisons as a shorthand for larger Boolean Expressions.

In this lecture we will learn how to chain comparison operators and we will also introduce two other important statements in python: and and or.

Let's look at a few examples of using chains:

In [1]:
1 < 2 < 3
Out[1]:
True
