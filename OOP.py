Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the major obstacles for beginners when they are first starting to learn Python.

There are many,many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to Google search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other useful tutorials online at the bottom of this Notebook.

For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building on the following topics:

Objects
Using the class keyword
Creating class attributes
Creating methods in a class
Learning about Inheritance
Learning about Special Methods for classes
Lets start the lesson by remembering about the Basic Python Objects. For example:

In [1]:
l = [1,2,3]
Remember how we could call methods on a list?

In [3]:
l.count(2)
Out[3]:
