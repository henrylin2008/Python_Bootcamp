Print Formatting
In this lecture we will briefly cover the various ways to format your print statements. As you code more and more, you will probably want to have print statements that can take in a variable into a printed string statement.

In [17]:
print 'This is a string'
This is a string

Strings

s = 'STRING'

Place another string with a mod and s: STRING
